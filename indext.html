    <P>git clone #link#
        git config --global user.name "your name"
        git config --global user.email "your email"
        check status : git status
        add staged file : git add filename (. instead of filename for all of file on added mode)
        commit staged file : git commit -m "your message"(write genuine message)
        when create new repo in vs code without create in website : add 1 file with readme.md file 
        git init -> when you are created new folder in your computer after in folder write this line ls -a 
        git push origin main  // git push -u origin main -u means set upstream for main branch 
        for next time you write only  ( GIT PUSH )
        git remote add origin #link#
        git remote -v (to verify remote)
        change branch name : git branch -M #main# main is common name for root branch
        git commit -am "message" ( -a means add and commit in one line with message)
        git branch ( to check branch name )
        git checkout # branch name #
        git checkout -b #new branch name# ( to create new branch and switch to that branch ) 
        git branch -d # branch name # ( to delete branch)
        
        case 1 : staged changes 
               git reset #fiel name#
               git reset ( for all file) 

        case 2 : commited changes ( for one commit )
                git reset HEAD~1  | for move backword on path

        case 3 : commited changes ( for many commits )
                git log ( to check commit hash)
                git reset #commit-hash#
                git reset --hard #commit-hash# ( for delete all changes after that commit hardly )
